Support the main flow:

 1. user (customer) create an intervention request
 2. BRUNO will dispatch a message to all the service providers that match (i.e.: are able to handle) the request
 3. the services providers, when receiving the request will be able to do (in function of the req. type):
    - offer price + intervention date (if request is "urgent")
    - offer an inspection + date -> then offer a "quote" for the intervention
 4. user (customer) select service provider
 5. the selected service provider will receive the OK notification, the others the NOK
 6. ... the selected service provider will do the work ...
 7. the service provider will mark the intervention as DONE
 8. the user can give feedback
